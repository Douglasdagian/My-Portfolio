<div id="ABOUT ME">

    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p>I am the second born in the family of three children, raised by a single mother in Nairobi.I have attended school from primary to adiploma which i amcurrently doing I.T (coding and programming), this journey has not been easy becouse i can
        remember there are many times i was sent home for schoolfees especially when i was in high school, my mother couldn't afford to pay schoolfees for the two of us.
    </p>

    <p>It reached a point when i was in form two i thought of dropping out becouse of beeing sent home numerouse times ,like every time people had tobe sent home i knew that i wount survive so i had to prepare myself when i hered about fee balance
        ,it was an embaressment to me whe people saw that every term i am home doing nothing ,sometimes i pretended tht i am sick just to evade the gossiping of people, staying at home really draged me behind i even started performing poorly in
        school.
    </p>

    <p>I love playig football, and creative arts drawing the most also i love technology most thing to do with gadgets and elecronics.When i was young i used to connect wires, batterys, motors, and bulbs my joy was to see them working as i expected.
        I am antisocial sometimes and thatswhat i am trying to work on,i am noteasy to make friends it takes timeor me but i seepeopleare somehoweasy to make friendship in thefirstmeeting, i am in a certain organisation wherewe train the kids
        on socil abehaviours, that confidence of talking to many people is what i am gaining and ibelievethat soon enough i will be making friends easily like other people.
    </p>
    <p>On my free time i listen to music, watch movies, draw pictures, or play soccer,i also like making box houses becouse they look good and it can also be sold for decoration in the house</p>
